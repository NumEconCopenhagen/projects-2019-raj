The Betrand model is often based on firms competing in an oligopoly (few companies) market with homogeneous products. Where the firms are setting the prices and the consumers are choosing a quantity based on the given price. 

The first part of the project will look at Betrand model with no cooperation between the two firms in the Model. This part will show that two firms set their prices equal to the marginal cost, and are therefor competing under perfect competition with zero profit.   

Secondly will the project look at a situation with collusion (cartel). Here will the two firms cooperate on the market and and set a price higher then the marginal cost. This part will therefor investigate what happen to the profit and welfare under cooperation.
